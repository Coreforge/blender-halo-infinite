# blender-halo-infinite

This plugin is based on HIME by MontagueM (https://github.com/MontagueM/HaloInfiniteModelExtractor).

To install this addon, download the code and compress the folder the code is in as a zip file. If the code isn't in a subfolder in the zip archive, blender won't properly recognize it.

To import models, make sure all related chunk files are in the same folder and import the .render_model file.
